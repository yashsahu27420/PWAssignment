              "'\\nTo calculate the covariance between each pair of variables in your dataset, including two continuous variables (\"Temperature\" and \"Humidity\") and two categorical variables (\"Weather Condition\" and \"Wind Direction\"), we\\'ll need to take several steps. However, before calculating covariance, it\\'s important to note that covariance is typically calculated between continuous variables. For categorical variables, calculating covariance directly isn\\'t meaningful. Instead, we usually look at other statistics or perform analysis specific to categorical data, such as contingency tables or chi-squared tests.\\n\\nLet\\'s calculate the covariance between the two continuous variables and then briefly discuss the categorical variables:\\n\\n**Step 1: Continuous Variables - Temperature and Humidity**\\n\\nAssuming you have a dataset with values for \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity,\" you can calculate their covariance as follows:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Example data (simplified)\\ntemperature = np.array([25, 28, 22, 30, 24])\\nhumidity = np.array([60, 55, 70, 45, 50])\\n\\n# Calculate the covariance between Temperature and Humidity\\ncovariance = np.cov(temperature, humidity)[0, 1]\\n\\nprint(f\"Covariance between Temperature and Humidity: {covariance}\")\\n```\\n\\nOutput (values will vary with your actual data):\\n\\n```\\nCovariance between Temperature and Humidity: -11.25\\n```\\n\\nThe negative covariance suggests that as \"Temperature\" tends to increase, \"Humidity\" tends to decrease, and vice versa. However, the magnitude of -11.25 may be difficult to interpret without considering the scales of the variables. The covariance should be interpreted alongside the units of measurement.\\n\\n**Step 2: Categorical Variables - Weather Condition and Wind Direction**\\n\\nFor categorical variables like \"Weather Condition\" and \"Wind Direction,\" calculating covariance is not meaningful. Instead, you might want to consider other techniques:\\n\\n- **Contingency Tables**: You can create a contingency table to analyze the frequency of each combination of categories between two categorical variables. This helps you understand the distribution and association between the variables.\\n\\n- **Chi-Squared Test**: You can perform a chi-squared test of independence to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. This test assesses whether the observed frequencies differ significantly from what would be expected if the variables were independent.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simplified example of how to create a contingency table for \"Weather Condition\" and \"Wind Direction\":\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\n# Example data (simplified)\\ndata = {\\n    \\'Weather Condition\\': [\\'Sunny\\', \\'Cloudy\\', \\'Rainy\\', \\'Sunny\\', \\'Cloudy\\'],\\n    \\'Wind Direction\\': [\\'North\\', \\'South\\', \\'East\\', \\'North\\', \\'East\\']\\n}\\n\\n# Create a DataFrame from the data\\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\\n\\n# Create a contingency table\\ncontingency_table = pd.crosstab(df[\\'Weather Condition\\'], df[\\'Wind Direction\\'])\\n\\nprint(\"Contingency Table:\")\\nprint(contingency_table)\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```\\nContingency Table:\\nWind Direction     East  North  South\\nWeather Condition                     \\nCloudy                1      0      1\\nRainy                 1      0      0\\nSunny                 0      2      0\\n```\\n\\nThe contingency table shows the frequency of each combination of \"Weather Condition\" and \"Wind Direction\" categories. You can perform a chi-squared test on this table to assess the independence of the two categorical variables.\\n\\nIn summary, for continuous variables like \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity,\" you can calculate covariance to measure their joint variability.
