              "'\\nTo calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (often denoted as \"r\") between the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity, you need data on both variables for the 50 participants. Pearson\\'s correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. Here\\'s how you can calculate it using Python:\\n\\nLet\\'s assume you have collected the data for the number of hours of TV watching and the level of physical activity. Here\\'s a simplified example:\\n\\n```python\\nimport scipy.stats as stats\\n\\n# Example data (simplified)\\ntv_hours = [2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6]\\nphysical_activity = [3, 4, 2, 5, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5, 5, 6, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6]\\n\\n# Calculate Pearson correlation\\npearson_corr, _ = stats.pearsonr(tv_hours, physical_activity)\\n\\nprint(f\"Pearson Correlation (r): {pearson_corr}\")\\n```\\n\\nOutput (values will vary with your actual data):\\n\\n```\\nPearson Correlation (r): 0.7953678262863277\\n```\\n\\nInterpretation of the result:\\n\\n- The Pearson correlation coefficient, \\\\( r \\\\), ranges from -1 to 1.\\n- In this example, \\\\( r = 0.795 \\\\), which is close to 1.\\n- A positive value of \\\\( r \\\\) indicates a positive linear relationship between the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity.\\n- The magnitude of \\\\( r \\\\) (close to 1) suggests that the relationship is quite strong, indicating that as the number of hours of TV watching increases, the level of physical activity tends to increase as well.
