Kernel Functions:\\n   - Kernel functions are primarily used in the context of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and other kernel-based algorithms in machine learning.\\n   - SVMs are linear classifiers that aim to find the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin. However, not all data is linearly separable in the original feature space. To handle non-linearly separable data, kernel functions are used to map the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable.\\n   - Common kernel functions include the polynomial kernel, radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and sigmoid kernel. The polynomial kernel, in particular, is used to introduce polynomial terms into the feature space, just like in polynomial regression.
