        "Handling imbalanced datasets in logistic regression is important because the model may be biased toward the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class. Here are some strategies for dealing with class imbalance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Resampling Techniques:**\n",
        "   - **Oversampling:** Increase the number of instances in the minority class by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples (e.g., using SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).\n",
