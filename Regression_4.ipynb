        "\n",
        "'''\n",
        "Lasso Regression is primarily designed for linear regression problems, meaning it assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. However, it can be adapted to address non-linear regression problems with some modifications. Here are a few ways you can use Lasso Regression for non-linear regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Feature Engineering:** One common approach is to create new features by transforming the existing ones to capture non-linear relationships. For example, you can add polynomial features by squaring or cubing the original features. By doing so, you transform the problem into a linear regression problem in the higher-dimensional feature space, which Lasso can handle.\n",
        "\n",
        "   For instance, if you have a single feature x, you can create additional features like x^2, x^3, etc., and then apply Lasso Regression to the extended feature set. This approach allows Lasso to capture non-linear patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Kernel Tricks:** Another method is to use kernelized versions of Lasso, such as Kernel Ridge Regression. Kernel Ridge Regression employs kernel functions (e.g., polynomial kernels or Gaussian kernels) to implicitly map the input features into a higher-dimensional space. In this transformed space, linear regression can capture non-linear relationships. The regularization parameter can still be used to control model complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Piecewise Linear Approximation:** You can break the non-linear problem into smaller linear segments and apply Lasso to each segment. This is also known as piecewise linear approximation. By using different Lasso models for different regions of the data, you can piece together a model that approximates the non-linear relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Ensemble Techniques:** You can use ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, which inherently capture non-linear relationships. These techniques can handle non-linearity effectively without the need for explicit feature engineering or kernel transformations. However, they don't provide feature selection like Lasso does.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Neural Networks:** For highly complex and non-linear regression problems, deep learning models, such as neural networks, are often a suitable choice. Neural networks can automatically learn non-linear patterns from the data.

              "\"\\nLasso Regression is primarily designed for linear regression problems, meaning it assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. However, it can be adapted to address non-linear regression problems with some modifications. Here are a few ways you can use Lasso Regression for non-linear regression:\\n\\n1. **Feature Engineering:** One common approach is to create new features by transforming the existing ones to capture non-linear relationships. For example, you can add polynomial features by squaring or cubing the original features. By doing so, you transform the problem into a linear regression problem in the higher-dimensional feature space, which Lasso can handle.\\n\\n   For instance, if you have a single feature x, you can create additional features like x^2, x^3, etc., and then apply Lasso Regression to the extended feature set. This approach allows Lasso to capture non-linear patterns.\\n\\n2. **Kernel Tricks:** Another method is to use kernelized versions of Lasso, such as Kernel Ridge Regression. Kernel Ridge Regression employs kernel functions (e.g., polynomial kernels or Gaussian kernels) to implicitly map the input features into a higher-dimensional space. In this transformed space, linear regression can capture non-linear relationships. The regularization parameter can still be used to control model complexity.\\n\\n3. **Piecewise Linear Approximation:** You can break the non-linear problem into smaller linear segments and apply Lasso to each segment. This is also known as piecewise linear approximation. By using different Lasso models for different regions of the data, you can piece together a model that approximates the non-linear relationship.\\n\\n4. **Ensemble Techniques:** You can use ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, which inherently capture non-linear relationships. These techniques can handle non-linearity effectively without the need for explicit feature engineering or kernel transformations. However, they don't provide feature selection like Lasso does.\\n\\n5. **Neural Networks:** For highly complex and non-linear regression problems, deep learning models, such as neural networks, are often a suitable choice. Neural networks can automatically learn non-linear patterns from the data. However, they are more complex and may require larger amounts of data and computational resources compared to Lasso Regression.\\n\\nIn summary, while Lasso Regression is fundamentally a linear regression technique, it can be adapted for non-linear regression problems by using feature engineering, kernel tricks, piecewise linear approximation, or by combining it with other non-linear regression techniques.
