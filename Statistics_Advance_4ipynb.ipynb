        "Q1: A t-test is used for small sample sizes, while a z-test is for larger samples. For example, a t-test might assess if there's a significant difference in exam scores between two groups of students. A z-test could analyze the mean height difference between two large populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2: In a one-tailed test, significance is measured in one direction (either greater or smaller), while a two-tailed test considers significance in both directions. For instance, a one-tailed test might examine if a drug increases blood pressure, while a two-tailed test would assess if it changes blood pressure in any direction.\n",

        "Q3: Type 1 error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected (false positive), and Type 2 error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected (false negative). For example, rejecting a good drug (Type 1) or failing to reject a useless drug (Type 2).\n",

        "Q5: A confidence interval is a range around a sample statistic, indicating the likely range of values for the population parameter. To calculate, use formula: CI = X̄ ± Z * (σ/√n). Example: A 95% CI for a mean of 50 with a standard deviation of 5 and a sample size of 30 is 48.68 to 51.32.\n",

        "Q8: The margin of error is the range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. Larger sample sizes lead to smaller margins of error. For example, a sample of 1000 may have a smaller margin of error than a sample of 100.\n",
