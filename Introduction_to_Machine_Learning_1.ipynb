        "\n",
        "AI is the broader concept of machines mimicking human intelligence. ML is a subset of AI, focusing on algorithms learning from data. DL is a subset of ML, utilizing neural networks. DS, or Data Science, encompasses techniques for extracting insights and knowledge from data, including AI and ML.\n",

        "\n",
        "Supervised learning uses labeled data for training, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data, and semi-supervised learning combines both labeled and unlabeled data for training. Supervised deals with prediction, unsupervised with discovering patterns, and semi-supervised is a mix, useful when labeling data is expensive.\n",

        "Q6: What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
        "\n",
        "Train, test, and validation split refers to dividing a dataset into portions for training, evaluating, and validating a model. Training data builds the model, test data assesses its performance, and validation data helps fine-tune parameters, preventing overfitting and ensuring generalization.\n",

        "Q7: How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning can detect anomalies by learning the normal patterns in data and identifying deviations. For example, clustering algorithms can group normal behavior, making anomalies stand out as outliers.\n",
